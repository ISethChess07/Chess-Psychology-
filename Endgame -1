Weakness in the pawn Structure can oblige the defender to stay passive. As this is the case here White should maintain the bind and bring up his King to help keep Black tied up. 

White has slightly better Pawn Structure and actively deployed pieces. It may not be enought to WIN but can make the Opponent defensive task very unpleasant,in part bco Counterplay is not easy to find.

A pure Rook ending generally gives the Defender better chances , particularly if he can activate the Rook, 
So White keeps the Knights.
