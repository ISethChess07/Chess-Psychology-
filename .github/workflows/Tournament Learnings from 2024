Chess : learnings from Tournament 


You are losing focus and concentration when the opponent is repeating the Moves. 

Blundering happening which needs to be stopped.

Don't be in Assumption when the game is boring.
Stop playing the 10 mins games , play 15 /10 only or 30 mins 
Also you have to be more tenacious while playing.

Also If I am unable to dominate in the board I am losing out.

You have to find some advantage in the Opening.

You are not getting am advantage in opening with c4 always, like the game in 8th round you played d4.... You could have played d3 well. You need to understand 1 thing that everyone is playing Chess and they are familiar with the patterns. So you need to bring your Opponent out of the Patterns. 

Some of the Games I played below.
